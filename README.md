## About

Pagemail is a read it later service, built with React and Pocketbase. It's for saving links for later, and being reminded about them via email. Each day users are sent an email which contains a list of saved pages from the last 24 hours. The site is installable as a PWA on iOS and Android, and for iOS there is also a shortcut which you can use for OS share menu integration.
